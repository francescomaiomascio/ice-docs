# Overview

ICE Studio is a local-first cognitive development environment.

It runs a persistent system runtime that remains active independently of any project, providing memory, agents, and reasoning capabilities across sessions.

You interact with ICE Studio through a GUI, but the intelligence lives in the backend runtime.
