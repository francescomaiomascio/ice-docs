# ICE Studio

**Integrated Cognitive Environment**

ICE Studio is a development environment designed to operate as a coherent cognitive system.

It integrates code, knowledge, agents, runtime, logs, and interfaces into a single unified environment that persists across time and projects.

ICE Studio is not an IDE, not a chatbot, and not a plugin-based editor.

It introduces a new category of system: an **Integrated Cognitive Environment**.

## Core Principles

- One persistent system runtime
- Multiple cognitive layers
- Agent orchestration, not prompts
- Local-first by design
- Observable and inspectable at every level

## What You’ll Find Here

This documentation covers:

- how to get started
- how the system is structured
- how cognition is modeled
- how runtime and networking work
- how extensibility and security are enforced

ICE Studio is under active development.  
The documentation evolves together with the system.
