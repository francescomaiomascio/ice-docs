# ICE Docs

**Integrated Cognitive Environment — Conceptual Documentation**

---

## Manifesto

ICE is not a product.  
ICE is not a tool.  
ICE is not an IDE.

ICE is a **system-level cognitive architecture** designed to persist, reason, and evolve across time, projects, and contexts.

This documentation does **not** describe a filesystem.  
It does **not** mirror the current implementation line by line.

It describes the **conceptual architecture** of the ICE universe.

## What ICE Is

ICE is a **persistent cognitive system** that orchestrates:

- code
- knowledge
- agents
- runtime
- interfaces
- networks

as parts of a **single evolving environment**.

ICE treats cognition as a *first-class system concern*, not as a feature layered on top of tools.

There are no traditional "sessions".  
There is a **continuous system state**.

## ICE Lab — The Conceptual Universe

Within this documentation, ICE is structured as a set of **conceptual domains**.

They may currently live in the same repository or runtime.  
That is an implementation detail.

Conceptually, ICE is this:
