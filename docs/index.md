!!! note "What ICE Studio Is"
    ICE Studio is a **persistent cognitive system**, not a tool, not an IDE,
    and not an assistant.

---

ICE Studio is a **persistent cognitive system** designed to orchestrate
code, knowledge, agents, runtime, and interfaces as a single evolving environment.

It is not:
- an IDE
- an AI assistant
- a plugin-based editor

It defines a **new category of system**.

## What This Documentation Covers

- core concepts and terminology  
- system and runtime architecture  
- cognitive phases and lifecycle  
- agent orchestration and knowledge layers  
- networking, security, and extensibility  

This documentation reflects the **current state of the system**
and evolves alongside ICE Studio itself.
