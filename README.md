# ICE Documentation  
## Explanatory Knowledge of the ICE Ecosystem

This repository contains **documentation only**.

It exists to **explain**, **clarify**, and **transmit understanding**
of the ICE ecosystem and its components.

Documentation in ICE is **never authoritative**.

---

## Epistemic Status

ICE documentation has **derivative authority**.

- Axioms and invariants override documentation
- Specifications override documentation
- Runtime behavior is never justified by documentation text alone

If documentation contradicts the ICE Foundation,
the documentation is wrong.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

ICE documentation exists to:

- explain foundational concepts
- clarify system architecture
- describe runtime and engine behavior
- support learning and understanding
- transmit design rationale

It does **not** exist to:

- define truth
- introduce new rules
- act as a specification
- justify execution or authority

---

## Relationship to ICE Foundation

- ICE Foundation defines **what is true**
- Documentation explains **how to understand what is true**

Documentation is epistemically downstream from the Foundation.

This separation is intentional and enforced.

---

## What You Will Find Here

This documentation covers:

- core concepts and terminology
- system and runtime architecture
- cognitive phases and lifecycle
- agent orchestration and knowledge layers
- networking, security, and extensibility

All content here must remain consistent with
axioms, invariants, and boundaries defined in ICE Foundation.

---

## Source Code

This repository contains **no source code**.

ICE implementations may be public or private,
but documentation remains explanatory regardless.

---

## Canonical Constraint

Documentation may clarify ICE.

Documentation may not define ICE.

Clarity does not imply authority.
